                 designed for large industrial real-time systems. Erlang
                 is dynamically typed and has a pattern matching syntax.
                 Functions are defined using recursion equations. Erlang
                 provides explicit concurrency, has asynchronous message
                 passing and is relatively free from side effects.
                 Distributed Erlang programs can run transparently on
                 cross-platform multi-vendor systems. The language has
                 primitives for detecting run-time errors and for
                 dynamic code replacement (i.e. changes to code can be
                 made in a running real-time system, without stopping
                 system).",
