* Introduction

This directory contains a Notepad++ user defined language (.xml) for Scala
programs.

More information about Notepad++ (Windows only) is available from:

   http://notepad-plus-plus.org/

* Installation

Copy the file "userDefineLang.xml" to the following location:

   %APPDATA%\Notepad++\

Restart your Notepad++ application.

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on.
