* Introduction

This directory contains a GTK langage specification (.lang) for Scala
programs and a plugin. The language specification is used in
particular by "gedit", the lightweight text editor for the Gnome
Desktop. The plugin is written for version 3 of gedit.

The latest revisions of the GTK language specifications are available from:

   http://cvs.gnome.org/viewcvs/gtksourceview/gtksourceview/language-specs/

The plugin adds the following features to gedit:

  * Adds a new Scala menu with options to run a Scala file, compile
    all Scala files in a directory and restart fsc
  * Automatically compiles files in the background every time you
    save.
  * Highlights compiler errors and warnings in the source.
  * Captures compiler / scala output in the "bottom panel" of Gedit
    (accessible via the View menu). Clicking on an error or warning
    scrolls you up to the line number the problem occurred on.

* Automatic installation

Download and run the (BASH) installer script on the command line like
this:

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/snim2/gedit-scala-plugin/master/install.sh
    $ chmod +x install.sh
    $ ./install.sh

This will install both the official Scala syntax highlighter for Scala
and the plugin.

* Manual installation

Copy the file "highlighting/scala.lang" to the following location:

   ~/.gnome2/gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs/

or alternatively to the location:

   /usr/share/gtksourceview-1.0/language-specs/

Restart your Gnome applications ("gedit", etc.).

From that point on, loading a file whose name ends in ".scala" automatically
turns Scala mode on.

To install the plugin, copy the files "plugin/flyscala.gedit-plugin",
"plugin/flyscala.plugin" and "plugin/flyscala.py" to the following
location:

    ~/.local/share/gedit/plugins/

To load the plugin, go to Edit -> Preferences in the gedit menu. Open
the Plugins tab and check the "Scala on the fly" plugin.
