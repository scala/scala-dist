% look in print. Authors are encouraged to use U.S. letter paper when 
% submitting to IEEE. Use the testflow package mentioned above to verify
% correct handling of both paper sizes by the author's LaTeX system.
%
% Also note that the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", option
% should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be displayed in
% draft mode.

% some very useful LaTeX packages include:

%\usepackage{cite}      % Written by Donald Arseneau
                        % V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format
                        % of the cite.sty package \cite{} output to follow
                        % that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
                        % result in citation numbers being automatically
                        % sorted and properly "ranged". i.e.,
                        % [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6]
                        % (without using cite.sty)
                        % will become:
                        % [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] (using cite.sty)
                        % cite.sty's \cite will automatically add leading
                        % space, if needed. Use cite.sty's noadjust option
                        % (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this
                        % off. cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/cite/

%\usepackage{graphicx}  % Written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz
                        % Required if you want graphics, photos, etc.
                        % graphicx.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
                        % systems. The latest version and documentation can

                        % Another good source of documentation is "Using
                        % Imported Graphics in LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl
                        % which can be found as esplatex.ps and epslatex.pdf
                        % at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
% NOTE: for dual use with latex and pdflatex, instead load graphicx like:
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage{graphicx}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
%\fi

% However, be warned that pdflatex will require graphics to be in PDF
% (not EPS) format and will preclude the use of PostScript based LaTeX
% packages such as psfrag.sty and pstricks.sty. IEEE conferences typically
% allow PDF graphics (and hence pdfLaTeX). However, IEEE journals do not
% (yet) allow image formats other than EPS or TIFF. Therefore, authors of
% journal papers should use traditional LaTeX with EPS graphics.
%
% The path(s) to the graphics files can also be declared: e.g.,
% \graphicspath{{../eps/}{../ps/}}
% if the graphics files are not located in the same directory as the
% .tex file. This can be done in each branch of the conditional above
% (after graphicx is loaded) to handle the EPS and PDF cases separately.
% In this way, full path information will not have to be specified in
% each \includegraphics command.
%
% Note that, when switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the new
% compiler will have to be run twice to clear some warnings.


%\usepackage{psfrag}    % Written by Craig Barratt, Michael C. Grant,

                        % graphics that have been generated by other

%\usepackage{stfloats}  % Written by Sigitas Tolusis
                        % Gives LaTeX2e the ability to do double column

                        % possible in LaTeX2e). This is an invasive package
                        % which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e output
                        % routines. It may not work with other packages that

                        % IEEE does not allow \baselineskip to stretch.
                        % Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
                        % that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
                        % that authors should try to avoid such use.
                        % Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or
                        % midfloat.sty package (by the same author) as IEEE
                        % does not format its papers in such ways.

%\usepackage{amsmath}   % From the American Mathematical Society
                        % A popular package that provides many helpful commands
                        % for dealing with mathematics. Note that the AMSmath
                        % package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000 thus
                        % preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline
                        % equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
                        % after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks
                        % as IEEEtran.cls normally does. amsmath.sty is already
                        % installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version
                        % and documentation can be obtained at:
                        % http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/



% Other popular packages for formatting tables and equations include:

%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty which improves the
% LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better appearances and
% additional user controls. array.sty is already installed on most systems.
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/

% Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools, especially mdwmath.sty and
% mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations and tables, respectively.
% The MDWtools set is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The lastest
% version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/mdwtools/


% V1.6 of IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can
% be used to generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc.


% Also of notable interest:

% Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating (automatically sized) equal
% width boxes. Available:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/eqparbox/



% Notes on hyperref:
% IEEEtran.cls attempts to be compliant with the hyperref package, written
% by Heiko Oberdiek and Sebastian Rahtz, which provides hyperlinks within
% a document as well as an index for PDF files (produced via pdflatex).
% However, it is a tad difficult to properly interface LaTeX classes and
% packages with this (necessarily) complex and invasive package. It is
% recommended that hyperref not be used for work that is to be submitted
% to the IEEE. Users who wish to use hyperref *must* ensure that their
% hyperref version is 6.72u or later *and* IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6b
% or later. The latest version of hyperref can be obtained at:
%
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/hyperref/
%
% Also, be aware that cite.sty (as of version 3.9, 11/2001) and hyperref.sty
% (as of version 6.72t, 2002/07/25) do not work optimally together.
% To mediate the differences between these two packages, IEEEtran.cls, as
% of v1.6b, predefines a command that fools hyperref into thinking that
% the natbib package is being used - causing it not to modify the existing
% citation commands, and allowing cite.sty to operate as normal. However,
% as a result, citation numbers will not be hyperlinked. Another side effect
% of this approach is that the natbib.sty package will not properly load
% under IEEEtran.cls. However, current versions of natbib are not capable
% of compressing and sorting citation numbers in IEEE's style - so this
% should not be an issue. If, for some strange reason, the user wants to
% load natbib.sty under IEEEtran.cls, the following code must be placed
% before natbib.sty can be loaded:
%
% \makeatletter
% \let\NAT@parse\undefined
% \makeatother
%
% Hyperref should be loaded differently depending on whether pdflatex
% or traditional latex is being used:
%
%\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
%\usepackage[hypertex]{hyperref}
%\else
%\usepackage[pdftex,hypertexnames=false]{hyperref}
%\fi
%
% Pdflatex produces superior hyperref results and is the recommended
% compiler for such use.



% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\section{Introduction}
% The very first letter is a 2 line initial drop letter followed
% by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \PARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by IEEE):
% \PARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \PARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\PARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter file"
for IEEE journal papers produced under \LaTeX\ using IEEEtran.cls version
1.6b and later.
% You must have at least 2 lines in the paragraph with the drop letter
% (should never be an issue)
 May all your publication endeavors be successful.
